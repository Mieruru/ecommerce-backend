## Description

In this assignment, an e-commerce application is provided in which create a back-end system for managing a PostgreSQL database using Sequelize's tools for more easily creating and formatting API endpoints. As we move away from handling SQL-based databases directly, libraries for implementing SQL-like functions directly into javascript code allow for more streamlined methods for performing CRUD operations.
